  <h1>What Is Pollution?</h1>
  <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called
    pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as
    trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</p>

<h1>What Causes Pollution</h1>

<p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called
    pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as
    trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.Pollutants in the ocean make their way back to humans. Small organisms ingest toxins and are eaten by larger predators, many of which are seafood that we eventually eat. When the toxins in contaminated animals get deposited in human tissue, it can lead to long-term health conditions, cancer and birth defects.

For example, phytoplankton will absorb methylmercury (bacteria-converted mercury carried down to the ocean’s surface). This makes its way up the food chain when zooplankton eat the phytoplankton, then small fish eat the zooplankton, then bigger fish eat the smaller fish. By the time you reach a fish the size of a swordfish, they can contain a very high mercury load (in fact, swordfish contain one of the highest mercury loads). </p>

<h1>Air Pollution</h1>

<p>Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.

Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality.Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change.
