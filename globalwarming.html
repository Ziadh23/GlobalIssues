  <h1>What Is Global Warming?</h1>
  <p>
    Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850
    and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas
    levels in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

  <h1>What Causes Global Warming?</h1>

  <p>Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil
    burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for
    agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.
  </p>

  <p>The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
    by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive
    isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>In its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from
    countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide
    in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the
    principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.</p>

  <h1>How can we stop global warming?</h1>

  <p>Rising sea levels. Raging storms. Searing heat. Ferocious fires. Severe drought. Punishing floods. The effects of climate change are already threatening our health, our communities, our economy, our security, and our children’s future.

  What can you do? A whole lot, as it turns out. Americans, on average, produce 21 tons of carbon a year, about four times the global average. Personal action is, of course, no substitute for meaningful government policies. We still must limit carbon pollution and aggressively move away from dirty fossil fuels toward cleaner power.

  But it’s important to remember the equally vital contributions that can be made by private citizens—which is to say, by you. “Change only happens when individuals take action,” says clean energy advocate Aliya Haq. “There’s no other way, if it doesn’t start with people.”</p>
