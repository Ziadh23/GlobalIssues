  <h1>Additional notes</h1>
  <p>In this web site, you will find a variety of topics, each of which will present many links to outside information
    to provide back up or an illustration of the points that are made. Please note that the contents of these external
    web pages are beyond my control and are used only to serve as an example of an issue I am presenting. If you follow
    one of these links, you can always navigate back to this web site using your browserâ€™s Back button.
    (Some framed web sites may prevent you easily getting back to this site in that way, in which case you can either
    type the URL: http://www.globalissues.org in the URL/address text box, or you can (on some of the newer web
    browsers) select from a list of previously visited web sites to get back.
    Because of the large number of links on this web site to external sites, there may be times when, again beyond my
    control, an external link could become unreachable. This may be because it turns out that the web site is
    temporarily down, or it has removed, archived or restructured their site after a certain time. I try my best to stay
    up to date and modify my links accordingly, if possible. However, if I do miss out some links and you find that they
    do not point to where it should do, please let me know.
    Also please note that linking to other resources and web sites does not mean that I necessarily endorse or support
    the views and positions etc of those other sites, but that I link to them to highlight an aspect of a given issue.
    I have tried my best to test this page on different operating system and browser combinations, but there are so
    many, that it would be impossible to test all, and, I have limited resources. Please let me know if you have
    problems using the site.
